## Description

A simple application to teach a user about any dog or cat breed searched. It also provides random fun facts on cats and dogs

We wanted to create an application that helps a user decide what kind of pet to adopt. Our app allows a user to input any breed of dog or cat and receive information on that breed. It will also save the userâ€™s past searches for easy access

User Story:
AS A user looking to learn more on various dog and/or cat breeds
I WANT TO receive information on selected breeds
SO THAT I CAN decide what to adopt


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, user can click on either button, 'Dog Fact' or 'Cat Fact', to receive random facts on either species. If the user scrolls down, he/she can input any breed of dog or cat into the search bar, select 'Dog' or 'Cat', and submit to receive information on that breed.

These searches will save to local storage as buttons so the user can easily look at past searches. There is also a button to clear history that will remove the past search buttons and any searches saved in local storage.
